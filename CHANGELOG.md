# Changelog

All notable changes to TextGraph are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres
to Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Non-UTF-8 ingestion crash.** `normalize()` decoded with strict UTF-8, so any
  undecodable byte (OCR output, mixed-encoding logs, binary-ish content — all in
  the L0 format matrix) raised `UnicodeDecodeError` and crashed `textgraph build`.
  Now decodes with `surrogateescape`: each undecodable byte becomes one lone
  surrogate that re-encodes to the exact original byte, so offset fidelity (G3)
  and determinism (G1) are preserved and the pipeline degrades gracefully (§5.4).
  Added regression tests and a `mixed-encoding.log` fixture (pinned binary) that
  flows through the determinism and provenance-integrity gates.

### Notes
- Read all three source documents in full (research `.md`, blueprint PDF, gap
  analysis DOCX) and reconciled Phase 0 against them. Recorded the §4.2-vs-§6.4
  L1 confidence-tag discrepancy in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (resolved to `STRUCTURAL`).

### Added — Phase 0: Repository & CI/CD foundation
- Repository scaffold for the full L0–L9 layer stack (`textgraph/l0_ingest` …
  `l9_artifacts`, `store/`, `mcp/`).
- Core primitives, fully unit-tested:
  - blake3 content addressing (`doc_id`, span re-verification).
  - Run-length-encoded offset maps (canonical char span → raw byte span).
  - `CanonicalDoc` + UTF-8/CRLF/BOM-safe normalization.
  - Canonical JSON serialization (byte-stable output, G1).
  - Pinned `Config` + config hashing.
- `GraphStore` interface with the four-tier confidence taxonomy and byte-span
  provenance types.
- Trivial deterministic pipeline + `textgraph build` / `textgraph version` CLI.
- CI: lint-and-typecheck, test (Python 3.11/3.12 matrix, coverage gate on `core/`),
  **determinism** (byte-identical `graph.json`), pre-commit, benchmark (nightly),
  and release (re-runs determinism against the built artifact).
- JSON Schemas for `graph.json` and `manifest.json`; `schema.yaml` template.
- Docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SKILL.md`, `docs/how-it-works.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `PLAN.md`.
