## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase 0: Repository & CI/CD foundation
- Repository scaffold for the full L0–L9 layer stack (`textgraph/l0_ingest` …
  `l9_artifacts`, `store/`, `mcp/`).
- Core primitives, fully unit-tested:
  - blake3 content addressing (`doc_id`, span re-verification).
  - Run-length-encoded offset maps (canonical char span → raw byte span).
  - `CanonicalDoc` + UTF-8/CRLF/BOM-safe normalization.
  - Canonical JSON serialization (byte-stable output, G1).
  - Pinned `Config` + config hashing.
- `GraphStore` interface with the four-tier confidence taxonomy and byte-span
  provenance types.
- Trivial deterministic pipeline + `textgraph build` / `textgraph version` CLI.
- CI: lint-and-typecheck, test (Python 3.11/3.12 matrix, coverage gate on `core/`),
  **determinism** (byte-identical `graph.json`), pre-commit, benchmark (nightly),
  and release (re-runs determinism against the built artifact).
- JSON Schemas for `graph.json` and `manifest.json`; `schema.yaml` template.
- Docs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SKILL.md`, `docs/how-it-works.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `PLAN.md`.
